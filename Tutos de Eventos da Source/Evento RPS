Descriзгo do Evento Rank PvP System:

1 - PvP System:
Х	Added new method for PvP counting. It's secured by time limiter, and basic protections like same IP, clan etc. If time protecion is working then legall kills not rising. If killer kill victim and time is OK, so then I call it "Legal Kill", if killer kill victim again, PvP counter rise but not Legal Kill (Time Protection sorks). All informations are stored in DB. This "Time Protection" should reduce farming. (More: if we set min pvp lvl on 76+ so then it will be hard to farm on bots. Protection should reduce farm on low rate servers. If we set max player kills on: 1, it lock Legal Kills counter after 1 kill, it's mean killer can kill victim only once in game , option can be useful on servers with big online).
Х	System works in every place, but is possible to deactivate it in specific areas like: PEACEFUL ZONE.

2. Rank System:
Х	Based on PvP System, it's mean, killer can earn exp for kill player, then he rise his rank too if earn 100%. (exp is based on current Rank Points [RP]).
Х	Default 42 ranks.
Х	Reward for rise up the Rank can be awarded for each level of Rank Points. (List  of rewards and minimum rank points for obtain reward in database).
Х	Included images for ranks and exp bar (loaded from server side).

3. Reward System:
Х	There is 2 reward types: for Legal Kill player, and for Legal Kill player with Rank.
Х	Each kill gives special currency called RPC, the RPC can be exchanged for items.
Х	Based on PvP System, killer can be rewarded for Legal Kill or not.
Х	Standard PvP Rewards, Rank Level Rewards and Rank PvP Rewards are configurable and can be on/off in config.
4. Death Manager:
Х	Is allowed to enable Death Manager, it's mean additional buttons in Death PvP Status Window showing details of killer like (CP, HP, MP, equipment (enchant) only for kill moment).

5. War Counter:
Х	Count kills if target is in War Clan. Legal kills rules are used.

6. Combo  Kill System:
Х	Shout messages (local/global) about the killer who doing a combo, all these messages are configurable.
Х	Combo system allows multiply Rank Points by special ratio defined in configuration file.
 
7. Configurability:
